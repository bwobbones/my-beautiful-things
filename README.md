## My Beautiful Things

### About

For as long as I've known her, Lexi has made the most beautiful things.  She takes a photo of them which 
is stored in our photo collection somewhere and then she gives the beautiful thing away to someone she
loves.  She is the most generous person I know, some of these beautiful things take months to make.

Rather that show off her beautiful things on Facebook or Pinterest, Lexi holds her beautiful things near
to her heart and shares them only with whoever is lucky enough to receive them.  To share them with anyone
else would in a small way de-value them and reduce their specialness.

This app is to help keep a little bit of each beautiful thing in a special place just for her.  It's my way
of making my own beautiful thing for my most beautiful thing in the world.  Our son Jack custom made all the 
artwork and worked out the colours.  Our children all immediately saw the value in finding a place for Mum to keep
the beautiful things she'd made just for them.

You can take a photo, write a story and most of all remember each of the wonderful things that you make without
worrying about it getting to the internet, everything is stored on your phone just for you. 

Feel free to log issues, or raise PRs, everyone is welcome!

### Technical Detail

This app was created with create-react-native-app, then ejected to allow native library use.

At the moment, it's concentrated on iOS usage but I'm sure that getting it up and running in Android wouldn't be that big a deal.

#### To Build

* Clone the repo
* `npm i`

#### To Run

* `npm run ios`

I think you'll need XCode command line tools installed, at this time I have XCode 9.2 installed.
